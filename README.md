# algosy

This is repo with 1st lab on algorithms. Just forget about all files except main.cpp  
There is main.cpp with checks, file mapping and quick sort.  
  
heap, merge and quick (why did I duplicate it??) are files with other algorithms, but without SUPER FAST IO (file mapping) and some checks.  
  
Also in this files there is cunning like an ass way to read input file (only 1 syscall)
